This project is a MERN stack recipe manager called Dish Diary. Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and the MVC pattern throughout. The backend uses ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS. The frontend is a Vite React app (JavaScript, not TypeScript). Cloudinary is used for image uploads. Follow best practices for both client and server code.
